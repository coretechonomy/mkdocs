# Google Chrome Profiles

## How to switch and choose the right one...

Google Chrome is now prompting users to switch to a different profile when it detects a new login. Chrome profiles are nothing new â€” they allow you to swap between Google accounts; keep personalized extensions, apps, history, themes, and bookmarks for different users on shared computers; and sync those settings between devices as well.

!!! tip
    With profiles, you can keep all your Chrome info separate, like bookmarks, history, passwords, and other settings. This is ideal when you are sharing a computer with multiple people. 


You may be caught by surprise if you switch to a different profile and notice your bookmarks are missing. Don't worry! They're still there, but you'll need to switch to the previous profile to see them. You may need to check through a few different profiles to find the right one, but it's most likely a generic looking one. **For example:** `Profile 2`. Follow the steps below to get a handle on profiles.
